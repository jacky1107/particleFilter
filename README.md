(b) how to compile and run your program
You could set this two parameters "P.OBSTACLE_NUMBER" and "P.PARTICLE_NUMBER" in main.py, this two parameters means number of obstacles and number of particles separately.
run my program:
    ``python main.py``

(c) any interesting features and extensions of your assignment.
Because there have some bugs I stuck in, so unfortunately I didn't make any interesting features.
